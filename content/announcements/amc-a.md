For everyone taking the AMC 10/12 A, the test is coming up soon and we have some more important details you should know. 

It will be on January 30th, which is after school on Thursday. Please aim to be at **Portable 1/2**, Mrs. Reinsch's room, **by 3:10 at the latest**, so we can start as soon as possible. Also, please do not bring calculators or paper of any type into the test. You may bring pencils, rulers, erasers, and protractors if you would like to. 

For the day before, make sure you get enough sleep to come in prepared for the test, which will be 75 minutes long with no breaks. I am confident that y'all will do fantastic!

Lastly, good luck! All the hard work you have put in through attending a math class, club, or studying will be helpful.
