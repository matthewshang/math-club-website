I hope all of you have been embracing joy and warmth as we near the holiday season. There's only two more weeks until winter break so hang in there! Also, there is only ONE more math club meeting for this year AND decade so I highly encourage you to attend next week...

<u>\*\*ATTENTION\*\*</u>
We finally have the highly anticipated SKYLINE MATH CLUB WEBSITE up and running! It is still in the process of aesthetic appeal and fully updated information but I'd encourage you to check it out at [skylinemath.club](skylinemath.club). We have our own domain so it is pretty cool. It is also now linked below in my signature!

<u>Debrief from Club Meeting today</u>
As always, Vishal and Matthew lead with a Math Meme Monday and a presentation of the challenge problem from last week, as well as the new challenge problem. Matthew went over a couple more AMC math tips that will also be linked below for your convenience, and everyone worked on an AMC handout afterwards. 

<u>Next Week's Meeting!</u>
Next week's meeting will be our annual math club holiday party! You may bring food if you wish but please do not feel obligated to do so. Additionally, ASB wants to do a couple of club recognition highlights, so they may come in sometime next week just to film 'a day in the life' of a math club member. With that said, PLEASE try your best to make it next week! We have really fun things planned and would love it if everyone could join us. I will also send out a reminder email on Sunday!

That's all I have for today. Have a wonderful week!
