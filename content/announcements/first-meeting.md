Thank you for a great first meeting! It was so nice to see so many returning members and new members as well! We went over our board members for the 2019-2020 school year, had a fun icebreaker activity, and broke down what future math club meetings would look like. I have linked the powerpoint that we presented today for your convenience! Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Hope to see you all at the next meeting! Have an amazing week!
