All jokes aside, there's a couple of important points to go over ESPECIALLY if you are planning to compete in Math is Cool. For those of you who aren't, we mostly went over MIC logistics today, but the challenge question of the week is also linked below if you would like to try solving it! Remember that there is NO meeting next week because we will not have school, so you will have 2 weeks to work on this problem!

\*\*The following part will ONLY be applicable to those going to Math is Cool\*\*

**PARENT VOLUNTEERS! \*\*\*TOP PRIORITY\*\*\***
It is extremely important that we have at least two parent volunteers, because we cannot go to competition without them! Please ask your parents if they are willing to chaperone by **THIS THURSDAY (10/10)**. If they can, PLEASE fill out this google form. Their help is very much appreciated!

**Studying for Math is Cool**
The competition is coming up soon, so it is in your best interest to start studying if you haven't already. The best way to study is to drill old Math is Cool tests, which are all linked HERE: https://www.academicsarecool.com/#/samples

Today at Math Club, we did the Team 2018-2019 "Champs" test for 9/10 and 11/12. Depending on your grade, click on the corresponding grade level and work on the most recent past tests, as those will be the most similar to what the test will be like this year. The MASTERS is generally harder, so if you feel confident with the CHAMPS, feel free to move on to the MASTERS set. 

**Potential Friday Meeting**
Depending on popularity, we may or may not have a Friday after school review session for Math is Cool preparation. This will be the Friday before MIC (October 18th), so please fill out the form REGARDLESS if you can make it or not! This will indicate to us how many practices/tests we should prepare.

Transportation
If for any reason you have trouble getting to or from Math is Cool, please email back and we will help you out! Remember, MIC is held at LIBERTY HIGH SCHOOL this year, NOT Redmond. Especially for those of you whose parents are planning to drop and pick you up, PLEASE talk to them about chaperoning. It will save them an extra car trip, aka an hour drive (about 30 mins there, 30 mins back) :) 

\*\*\*END MIC INFO\*\*\*

Thanks for reading this long email again! And as always, if anyone has any questions or concerns at all, regarding Math is Cool or about meetings in general, always feel free to email me! I will generally always email back within 24 hours. Have a great week everyone!
